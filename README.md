# J.P. Morgan Legal Document Classification - Business Problem

## üìù Project Overview

J P Morgan announced it had developed and deployed new software called COIN‚Äîshorthand for Contract
Intelligence‚Äîthat automates document review for a certain class of contracts. COIN does the mind-numbing job of
interpreting commercial loan agreements that consumed 360,000 hours of work each year by lawyers and loan officers
within seconds.


## Background Information:
The software employs image recognition to identify patterns in these agreements. While JPMorgan has been tight-lipped
about the details of the proprietary technology, the bank has stated that the algorithm digests data on the bank‚Äôs numerous
contracts and it can identify and categorize repeated clauses. The bank reports that the algorithm classifies clauses into one
of about one hundred and fifty different ‚Äúattributes‚Äù of credit contracts. For example, it may note certain patterns based on
clause wording or location in the agreement.

## Scenario:
The software reviews in seconds the number of contracts that previously took lawyers over 360,000 person-hours. Apart
from shortening the time it takes to review documents, COIN has also managed to help JP Morgan decrease its number
of loan-servicing mistakes. J P Morgan intends to deploy COIN for more complex filings, such as credit-default swaps and
custody agreements In the medium and long term, the bank also hopes to use machine learning to interpret altogether
new regulations.

Problem Statement/ Business objectives: How would you break the problem/scenario down with the help of CRISP-DM methodology: ‚ÄúAutomate the
classification of various legal documents‚Äù.
